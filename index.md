## About Me

I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Cognitive Systems Lab, Northeastern University. My primary advisor is Prof. <a href = "https://web.northeastern.edu/deniz/">Deniz Erdogmus</a>. My primary area of interest is in the intersection of signal processing, control and Machine learning. I closely collaborate with Prof. <a href = "https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/lisa-barrett/">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> on developing machine learning models to study the emerging patterns in human behaviour and emotion. I also work with <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6h7b0fAAAAAJ&hl=en">Jennifer Dy</a> on theoretical machine learning.

I received my Masters of Science (M.Sc.) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Northeastern University in May 2021 and Bachelor in Technology (B. Tech.) in Mechatronics (Minor. Robotics) from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2019. Aside from my current research I am extremely passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicle.

During my free time I love to indulge in conversation regarding geo-politics, stock market and chess. I enjoy reading manga or anime.
