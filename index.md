## About Me

I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Prof. <a href = "https://web.northeastern.edu/deniz/">Deniz Erdogmus</a> Cognitive Systems Lab, Northeastern University. I am also affiliated with PEN (Psychologists, Engineers, Neuroscientists) Cluster at Northeastern â€” a nexus of experimental and modeling driven studies of brain and peripheral nervous system and their interactions with the body. At Northeastern University mainly focuses on machine learning and cognitive science. I closely collaborate with Prof. <a href = "https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/lisa-barrett/">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6h7b0fAAAAAJ&hl=en">Jennifer Dy</a>.

Before  embarking on my Ph.D journey I received my Masters of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University in May 2021 and Bachelor in Technology in Mechatronics (Minor. Robotics) from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2019. During my MS and B.Tech my main interest was in building vision and navigation stack for autonomous vehicles. In summer 2021 I got the chance to work with Ford Greenfield Labs as an R&D intern.
