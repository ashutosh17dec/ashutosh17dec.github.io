## About Me

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Cognitive Systems Lab, Northeastern University where I am advised by Prof. <a href = "https://web.northeastern.edu/deniz/">Deniz Erdogmus</a>. My primary area of interest is in the intersection of Signal Processing, Control and Machine Learning. I’ve always been fascinated by the ease with which humans process information and make decisions.
My research involves developing machine learning models that can recognize patterns in time series data to help us understand the behavior of complex systems. My key projects involve designing machine learning models to discover emerging patterns in bio-signals that helps us study human behaviour.
I closely collaborate with Prof. <a href = "https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/lisa-barrett/">Lisa Feldman Barrett</a> to study the emerging patterns in fMRI datasets explaining human behaviour and emotions. I also work with Prof. <a href = "https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/matthew-goodwin/">Mathew Goodwin</a> to develop machine learning models that can help predict psychological state of the patient from their bio-signals, collected using wearable devices. 

I received my Masters of Science (M.Sc.) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Northeastern University in May 2021 and Bachelor in Technology (B. Tech.) in Mechatronics (Minor. Robotics) from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2019. Aside from my current research I am extremely passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicle.

During my free time I love to indulge in conversation regarding geo-politics, stock market and chess. I enjoy reading manga or watching anime too.
