## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Cognitive Systems Lab at Northeastern University, where I am advised by Prof. Deniz Erdogmus. My research lies at the intersection of signal processing, control, and machine learning. I am fascinated by the ease with which humans process information and make decisions, and I aim to replicate this efficiency in machine learning models.

My work focuses on developing algorithms to recognize patterns in time series data, particularly in bio-signals, to understand complex system behaviors. I have a keen interest in studying human behavior through these patterns. Currently, I am engaged in key projects that involve designing machine learning models to discover emerging patterns in bio-signals, aiding our understanding of human behavior.

I collaborate closely with Prof. Lisa Feldman Barrett to analyze fMRI datasets, uncovering patterns that explain human behavior and emotions. Additionally, I work with Prof. Mathew Goodwin on developing predictive models for psychological states based on bio-signals collected from wearable devices.

I hold a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from Northeastern University (2021) and a Bachelor in Technology (B.Tech.) in Mechatronics with a minor in Robotics from Manipal Institute of Technology (2019). Beyond my primary research, I am passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicles.

In my leisure time, I enjoy engaging in conversations about geopolitics, the stock market, and chess. I also love reading manga and watching anime.
